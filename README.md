# GitOps Duel: ArgoCD vs Flux

![GitOps Duel CI](https://github.com/justrunme/gitops-duel-argocd-vs-flux/actions/workflows/test-kind.yml/badge.svg)

This repository serves as a comprehensive demonstration and comparison of ArgoCD and Flux, two leading GitOps tools for Kubernetes. It showcases their distinct approaches to continuous delivery, self-healing capabilities, and provides a visual interface for comparing application states.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Deploy and manage applications using both ArgoCD and Flux within the same Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Unified Helm Chart Management:** All sample application deployments are now consistently managed via Helm charts, demonstrating a unified approach across both GitOps tools.
*   **Robust CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):** A single, consolidated GitHub Actions workflow automates:
    *   KinD cluster provisioning.
    *   Deployment of ArgoCD, Flux, and all sample applications.
    *   Building and deploying a custom UI for manifest comparison.
    *   **Automated Error Simulation:** Intentionally introduces discrepancies (e.g., deleting deployments, scaling replicas to zero) to rigorously test and verify the self-healing capabilities of ArgoCD and Flux.
    *   **Detailed Access Information:** Provides clear instructions and commands to access Grafana dashboards, the custom UI, and ArgoCD UI after a successful CI run, including dynamic password retrieval.
*   **Visual Monitoring with Grafana:** Integrated Grafana dashboards for both ArgoCD and Flux, allowing real-time monitoring of sync/suspend errors, reconciliation times, and overall system health.
*   **Custom UI for Manifest Comparison:** A simple web application built with React and Tailwind CSS that:
    *   Lists all applications managed by ArgoCD and Flux.
    *   Displays live Kubernetes manifests for each application.
    *   Highlights differences between the desired state (from Git) and the actual state in the cluster.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project sets up a Kubernetes cluster (KinD in CI, or Minikube/KinD locally) and deploys both ArgoCD and FluxCD. It then uses these GitOps tools to deploy sample Nginx applications, showcasing a fully Helm-based deployment strategy. A custom UI application is also deployed to provide a visual comparison interface.

## üí° GitOps Concepts

GitOps is an operational framework that applies DevOps best practices (like version control, collaboration, and CI/CD) to infrastructure automation. The Git repository becomes the single source of truth for your desired system state. Any changes to the system are made by updating the Git repository, and the GitOps tool (ArgoCD or FluxCD) automatically synchronizes the cluster to match this desired state.

### Pull-based vs. Push-based (Contextualized)

While both ArgoCD and Flux are "pull-based" in the sense that they pull configurations from Git, their internal mechanisms and typical deployment patterns can differ:

*   **ArgoCD (Pull-based):** ArgoCD agents run within the cluster and continuously monitor Git repositories for changes. When a change is detected, ArgoCD pulls the new configuration and applies it to the cluster. It has a strong focus on application lifecycle management and provides a rich UI.
*   **FluxCD (Pull-based with Event-driven Sync):** Flux also operates within the cluster, pulling configurations from Git. It's highly event-driven and can react to Git pushes or image updates. Flux's design emphasizes extensibility and composability, often integrating with other tools like Helm and Kustomize via custom resources (`HelmRelease`, `Kustomization`).

## ‚öîÔ∏è ArgoCD vs FluxCD Comparison

| Feature             | ArgoCD                                       | FluxCD                                         |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **UI**              | Rich, built-in UI for visualization & management | CLI-centric, with optional UI (e.g., Weave GitOps, custom UI in this project) |
| **Sync Model**      | Pull-based, continuous reconciliation        | Pull-based, event-driven reconciliation        |
| **Application Definition** | `Application` CRD                            | `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` CRDs         |
| **Helm Support**    | Excellent, native Helm chart support via `Application` CRD | Excellent, native `HelmRelease` CRD for managing Helm charts |

| **Extensibility**   | Plugins, custom resource support             | Highly extensible via GitOps Toolkit components |

## üí• Error Simulation Scenarios

The CI pipeline includes automated error simulation to demonstrate the self-healing capabilities of ArgoCD and Flux:

*   **Deployment Deletion:** The CI pipeline intentionally deletes the Nginx deployments managed by both ArgoCD and Flux. The GitOps tools are expected to detect this drift and automatically re-deploy the applications to restore the desired state.
*   **Replica Count Modification:** The CI pipeline scales down the Nginx deployments to zero replicas. ArgoCD and Flux are expected to detect this change and scale the deployments back up to the desired replica count defined in Git.

Each simulation includes a waiting period for self-healing and verification steps to confirm that the desired state has been restored.

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/test-kind.yml`)

The CI/CD pipeline is now consolidated into a single job, `gitops-duel-ci`, to ensure the KinD cluster persists throughout the entire workflow execution. This job performs the following steps sequentially:

1.  **`Checkout code`**: Checks out the repository code.
2.  **`Setup KinD`**: Provisions a KinD Kubernetes cluster.
3.  **`Setup Terraform`**: Installs and configures Terraform.
4.  **`Install Flux CLI`**: Installs the Flux command-line interface.
5.  **`Install ArgoCD CLI`**: Installs the ArgoCD command-line interface.
6.  **`Terraform Init`**: Initializes the Terraform working directory.
7.  **`Terraform Apply - Core Components (ArgoCD & Flux)`**: Applies Terraform configurations to deploy ArgoCD and Flux, including necessary CRD readiness checks.
8.  **`Wait for ArgoCD server`**: Waits for the ArgoCD server deployment to be available.
9.  **`Verify ArgoCD`**: Verifies the ArgoCD installation by checking its pods and applications.
10. **`Verify FluxCD`**: Verifies the FluxCD installation by checking its components.
11. **`Login to Docker Hub`**: Logs into Docker Hub to push images.
12. **`Build and push UI Backend`**: Builds and pushes the Docker image for the UI backend.
13. **`Build and push UI Frontend`**: Builds and pushes the Docker image for the UI frontend.
14. **`Deploy UI`**: Deploys the UI backend and frontend to the Kubernetes cluster.
15. **`Debug ArgoCD deployed apps`**: Provides debugging information for ArgoCD deployed applications.
16. **`Simulate ArgoCD Deployment Issues`**: Executes the ArgoCD error simulation scenario.
17. **`Simulate Flux Deployment Issues`**: Executes the Flux error simulation scenario.
18. **`Get Access Information`**: Retrieves dynamic access information, including the ArgoCD admin password.
19. **`Output Access Information`**: Prints detailed instructions for accessing the UI Dashboard, ArgoCD UI, and Grafana Dashboard.

## ‚úÖ Successful CI Runs and Fixes Applied

Throughout the development of this project, several challenges were encountered and successfully resolved within the CI pipeline:

*   **Terraform Syntax Errors:** Initial Terraform configurations contained syntax errors related to provider block types and `set` arguments, which were corrected to align with HCL syntax.
*   **Terraform CRD Timing Issues:** Resolved issues where Terraform attempted to create Kubernetes resources before their Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) were fully established in the cluster. This was addressed by implementing explicit waits for CRD readiness and, in some cases, switching to `kubectl_manifest` for better CRD lifecycle management.
*   **Helm Release Conflicts:** Addressed "cannot re-use a name that is still in use" errors by ensuring conflicting Helm releases were uninstalled before new deployments.
*   **Tailwind CSS PostCSS Configuration:** Fixed persistent build failures in the UI frontend related to Tailwind CSS's PostCSS plugin. This was resolved by downgrading Tailwind CSS to a version compatible with Create React App's internal PostCSS handling and correctly configuring `postcss.config.js`.
*   **Kubectl Connection Errors in CI:** Resolved issues where `kubectl` could not connect to the Kubernetes cluster in the CI environment. This was fixed by ensuring the KinD cluster was properly provisioned and its `kubeconfig` was accessible within the same CI job.
*   **Kubectl Command Syntax:** Corrected `kubectl` commands used in error simulation scenarios, specifically addressing the unsupported `--ignore-not-found` flag for `kubectl scale` and ensuring proper conditional execution.
*   **YAML Syntax and Variable Interpolation:** Addressed various YAML syntax errors, particularly those related to `heredoc` blocks and the correct interpolation of GitHub Actions variables within shell scripts, ensuring robust and error-free execution.

These fixes have contributed to a stable and reliable CI/CD pipeline, demonstrating the resilience and self-healing capabilities of both ArgoCD and Flux.
